 * <h2>The Game Engine Design 101 Project. (ged101)</h2>\n\n
 * <h3>Designed and Developed by Richard Marks 2008</h3>
 * This project is a serious effort to design and implement a reusable Cross-Platform Game Engine in the C++ language.\n\n
 *
 * Using the Allegro cross-platform library as a backend to provide an interface to the hardware of the machine that works
 * on Windows, Linux, MaC OSX, and a few other platforms, ged101 wraps the functionality of most of Allegro's functions in a
 * very modular C++ OOP fashion to provide a nice stable and easy to use platform for developing games.\n\n
 * 
 * Several highlights to the ged101 engine are support for loading PNG image files without having to resport to another library,
 * the ability to load and stream OGG/Vorbis audio files without needing another library, and the ability to focus on creating a
 * game, not an engine when you have that burst of inspiration to sit down and make a game!\n\n
 *
 * You are not stuck wondering how to do this or that to get a simple framework started for your game. Using the ged101 engine
 * could not be much easier. You just need to create the code for your game. And link to the ged101 library, add in some resources
 * like images, sounds, and level maps, and whamo! You've got a game on your hands!\n\n
 *
 * The easy to use architecture of the ged101 engine makes it a snap to create a working prototype in minutes.\n\n
 *
 * Just create a Game.h and a Game.cpp (you can copy/paste the included Game.h and Game.cpp file if you want to) and create your
 * game state classes that inherit from the ENGINE::GameState class. You implement the gamestates by filling in the functions
 * for Initialize() and Execute() and Destroy() and then you are pretty much finished with that.\n\n
 *
 * There will be tutorials for how to get started using ged101, both a breakout-type game and a mini-rpg walk around will be
 * covered in detail from the start to the finish of creating 2 working game demos.\n\n
 *
 * The ged101 engine is open-source, and licensed under the GNU GPL v2 license agreement.\n\n
 *
 * If you have suggestions for improving the code, just let me know.\n\n
